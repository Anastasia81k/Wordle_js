#Present to Your attention simple steps of playing in clone-game Wordle.

#In Wordle you're presented with five empty boxes, and you need to figure out which secret five-letter word fits in those boxes using no more than six guesses.

#Start with a word like FARTS. Hit Enter and the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns gray, that letter isn't in the secret word. If it turns yellow, that letter is in the word but in a different spot. And if it turns green you've got both the letter and placement correct. (There is a color-blind mode with higher-contrast colors as well.)

#In the next row, repeat the process for your next guess using what you learned from your previous guess. You have six tries, and can only use real words

#Гnfortunately I didn't guess the word. The correct world was "WHICH"
